# Introduction
A **Farmer Chatbot Application** developed using Reactjs, Tailwind CSS, Wishper API, and Chat GPT API.

## Functions Implemented
1. The user can send queries to the bot and it will answer accordingly.
2. There are predefined queries to help the user along the way.
3. Two-way conversation with asking directly and quick responses.
4. Users can ask queries with speech also. A speech-to-text functionality is also there.

## Design
1. It contains three pages: a home page, a bot page, and an exit page.
2. Minimalist design to keep all the functionality without much sensory overload.
3. The home page takes the user to the bot and the bot page to the exit page, from the exit page user can go to the home and bot pages.
4. Figma designs were made first with the help of a mood board and brainstorming.
